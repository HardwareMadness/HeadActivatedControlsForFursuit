##Make your fursuit or any other Project better with HeadActivatedControls. This Simple arduino Program helps you to control, maybe a fan to keep you cool or any other Peripheral by moving your head around.
To use this get any LSM6 based IMU and connect it to any Arduino.

In the Program you can customize anything, you can set the pins for each Axis at the top and you can set the threshold to set how fast you need to move your head. Place the IMU in your snout.
